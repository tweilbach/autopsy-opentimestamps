OpenIDE-Module-Display-Category=Ingest Module
OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    This module creates, upgrades and validates OpentimstampsOTS) proofs for all selected data sources as they are ingested.\n\n\
    The initial run will create the OTS proof for the data source. \
    Any subsequent run of the plugin will attempt to valdate the proof using the data source current state. \
    A report containing proof messages will be written per data source and added to the Reports section of the case.\n\n\
    This plugin can, and should be run, multiple times.\n\n\
    With an OTS proof is possible to irrefutably attest that a particular data source or file existed in its current form and unmodified, close to a point in time (whithin a few hours) to when the proof was created.\n\n\
